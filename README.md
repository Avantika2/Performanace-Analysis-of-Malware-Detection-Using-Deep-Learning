# Performanace-Analysis-of-Malware-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This was the mini project done my me and my other three teammates namely Sanjana Mahaptra, Radhika Edlabadkar and Vaishanavi Ratan.


Malware attacks has becoming the threats to our privacy and security in recent years. The traditional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis and heurastic analysis are laggig behind due to its disadvantages. Hence,in this project our aim was to analyse the performance of deep learning algorithms and find the best among them. For this purpose, we used Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Long-Shrt Term Memory(LSTM) and CNN+LSTM. The dataset was collected from [Microsoft Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data)
   
   
   **CNN**
   The sample dataset contains .asm and .bytes files. They are converted into grayscale images and then fed to CNN model. The accuracy obtained from this model was 86.50%.
   
  **LSTM**
    The pre-processing is done by tokenization and vectorzation. LSTM gave accuracy upto 89.7%.
    
   **CNN + LSTM**
    CNN and LSTM individually has shown satisfactory performance. Combining this two algorithms using binding ensemble technique, we obtained 92.01% accuracy.
