# Performanace-Analysis-of-Malware-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This was the mini project done my me and my other three teammates namely Sanjana Mahaptra, Radhika Edlabadkar and Vaishanavi Ratan.
  Malware attacks has becoming the threats to our privacy and security in recent years. The traditional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis and heurastic analysis are laggig behind due to its disadvantages. Hence,in this project our aim was to analyse the performance of deep learning algorithms and find the best among them. For this purpose, we used Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Long-Shrt Term Memory(LSTM) and CNN+LSTM.
